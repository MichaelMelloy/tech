        <div class="text">
            I started this website to learn HTML and CSS.<br>
            After quite some time I realised, that it is actually <br>
            imposible to fully comprehend the ins and outs of CSS... <br><br>

            After thinking what purpose this website may hold, <br>
            I decided to publish my "work" as an amateur Photographer <br>
            which is actually just me messing around with a camera. <br><br>

            I'm an 11th grade student from Germany studying <br>
            Computer Science as my primary subject and might <br>
            publish a couple of side projects to this site. <br><br>

            My Username Michael Melloy is a tribute <br>
            to Michael Malloy also known as Iron Mike who <br>
            survived multiple murder attempts on his life. <br>
            They gave him a Sandwich made from rotten sardines and <br>
            carpet tacs. Motherfucker asks for another.
